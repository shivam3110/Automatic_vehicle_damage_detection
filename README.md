### Problem Statement
In the context of vehicle damage detection, the primary challenges include:
- Identifying damaged areas on vehicles accurately.
- Segmenting damaged regions for precise assessment.
- Automating the assessment process for efficiency.

### Approach
This project employs instance segmentation, a computer vision technique that not only detects damaged areas on vehicles but also provides a detailed segmentation of the affected regions. The approach involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Preparation:** Utilizing the [Vehicle Damage Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hendrichscullen/vehide-dataset-automatic-vehicle-damage-detection), which contains images of damaged vehicles with corresponding annotations.
2. **Instance Segmentation:** Implementing instance segmentation using state-of-the-art techniques to accurately identify and segment damaged areas on vehicles.
3. **Results Analysis:** Providing detailed results and performance metrics in the project notebooks to assist users in understanding the model's effectiveness.
